Steam Market Seller
===================

A [greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) script that automatically prices and sells all items in your inventory for a particular game.


Currently has no UI and will sell all 'steam' (appid 753) items when loaded. You can just change the appid and other games will be sold.

* Dota 2: 570
* Counter-strike: GO: 730

The SteamMarket object can be used as a simple API to the steam market, and could be used for other market related tasks
